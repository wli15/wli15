Instead of generating a new page for every error message, we created an error variable
at the bottom of the login.html such that error would be assigned a value corresponding
to its respective error.

We bypassed checking if the login/password fields were empty by adding the required field
to our form inputs.

There is an issue where the web address would be /welcome instead of / while displaying the
login page after logging out, which we don't understand how to fix.
