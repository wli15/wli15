Database is a structured way to store data. MongolDB is "NoSQL" which means it does not store using related tables of data (no rows and columns)
MongolDB is a document database
Documents organizes data by field-value pairs. Fields are unique identifiers for specific datapoints. Much like a dictionary? 
Collections are multiple documents
Database are multiple collections
{
	<field> : <value>,
	"color" : "brown"
	"age" : 20
}

Altas Cloud data base uses mongoldb at its core. Atlas users deploy clusters(groups of servers to store data)?
The servers within a cluster are organized as replica sets (a few connected mongodb instances that store the same data)
Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud running a certain software
multiple instances in a server. Multiple server in a cluster
One server contains multiple copies of the same data so when one machine in the replica is broken, the others in the server will maintain that data.
0.0.0.0/0 as an ip means it can be accessed anywhere
username: m001-student

Clicking collections in the cluster shows the database and collections in the cluster.
