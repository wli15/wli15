HOW DATA IS STORED:
When updating the mongol shell, you use json (javascript standard object notation)
json format:
start and end documents with {}
seperate key and value with colons :
seperate key:value pair with commas ,
"keys" must be surrounded by quotation marks " "
"keys" are also called "fields"
{
	"_id" : "9237596-sdxv",
	"date" : "Jan 10th 2020",
	"certificate number" : 32458,
	"address" : {
		"city" : "NYC",
		"zip" : 21456,
		"Street" : "washington strret"
	} *this is a SUB DOCUMENT
}

Json is Text-based which is slow, consumes a lot of space, and limited ways in storing data
BSON = binary JSON -> bridges binary representation and JSON format
faster, flexible and low space consumption
MongolDB stores using BSON internally and over the network but still basically like JSON?
anything stored in Json can be retrieved in JSON
SO stored in BSON, viewed in JSON
HOW TO IMPORT AND EXPORT DATA:
When backing up data or exporting to a different system, BSON is faster
If you plan on viewing the data locally after exporting it, JSON is a better choice
4 COMMANDS: 
mongoimport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" 
			--drop=<filename>.json
imports data in JSON
mongoexport --uri "<AtlasCluster URI>"
			--collection=<collection name>
			--out=<filename>.json
exports data in JSON

mongorestore --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
			 --drop dump
imports data in BSON dump

mongodump --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
exports data in BSON


URI = Uniform Resource Identifier
mongoDB uses a srv string to connect to the cluster. More secure connection of your appication and the MongolDB instance.
mongodb+srv://user:password@clusterURI.mongodb.net/database




CODE USED in import and export
mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"

mongoexport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --collection=sales --out=sales.json

mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"  --drop dump

mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --drop sales.json

DATA EXPLORER:
can use in the Atlas ui by clicking collections
can open specific databases and the preset findtab will show you general overview.
In the filter search bar, you can follow the format to search specific documents with those same "key" : "value" pairs




Can connect to the cluster from the shell using commands instead of the UI
admin is the default database and can keep track of users in the database
show dbs show the list of databases in the cluste
use (database name)
show collections list all the collections that were shown in the UI
db.zips.find( {"state": "NY"})  <- notice how it doesnt ask for the database because prior we used the "use (databasename)" command
the db.zips.find would list all documents that have the state of NY restriction. 
Use it to "iterate through a cursor" it will show the next set of documents not shown before because of space
cursor-a pointer to a result set of a query
pointer-a direct address of the memory location
.find() returns a cursor with documents that match the find query
db.<collection name>.find(<query>).count() returns the num of documents that match the given query
db.<collection name>.find(<query>).pretty() returns documents that match the given query formatted for ease of reading
