Chapter 4 Notes
Query Operators - Comparison
MQL operators
Update operators
I.e. $inc, $set, #unset
Enables us to modify data in the database
Query Operators
Provide additional ways to locate data within the database
$ sign
Preceds MQL operators
Precedes Aggregation pipeline stages
Allows Access to Field Values
Comparison Operators
Allow us to find data within a certain range
$eq → EQual to
Used as default when an operator is not specified
$neq → Not EQual to
$gt →  Greater Than
$lt → Less Than
$gte → Greater Than or Equal to
$lte → Less Than or Equal to
All use the same syntax of {<field>: {<operator>: <value>}}
Query Operators - Logic
Allows us to be more granular in our search for data
{<operator>: [{statement1},{statemnet2},...]}
$and → Match all the specified query clauses
Used as the default operator when an operator is not specified
Need to use it when including the same operator more than once in a query
$or → At least one of the query clauses is matched
$nor → Fail to match both given clauses
{$not:{statement}}
$not → Negates the query requirement
Expressive Query operator 
Syntax: {$expr: {<expression>}}
Allows the use of aggregation expressions within the query language
Allows us to use the variables and conditional statements
$ also addresses the field value
Array Operators
$push → Allows us to add an element to an array and turns a field into an array field if it was previously a different type
Order matters in an array
Syntax: {<array field>:{“$size”:<number>}}
Returns a cursor with all documents where the specified array field is exactly the given length
Syntax: {<array field>:{“$all”:<number>}}
Returns a cursor with all documents where the specified array field contains all the given elements regardless of their order in the array
Projections
Syntax: db.<collection>.find({<query>}, {<projection>})
Inside <projection>, you put <field1>:0, <field2>: 0 etc where
1 - include the field
0 - exclude the field
Do not combine 1s and 0s in a projection
Syntax: {<field>:{“$elemMatch”: {<field>: <value> }}}
Matches documents that contain an array field with at least one element that matches the specified query criteria, OR
Projects only the array elements with at least one element that matches the specified criteria
