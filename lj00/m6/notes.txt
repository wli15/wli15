Chapter 6
On the ui there are many thing you can do:
Create visual representations of the data
Look at a representation of the pipeline through the aggregation tab
Export pipeline code to different programming languages
Compass is another tool:
Connect using the link in the database connections button
NEVER touch the admin, config, and local databases in the compass
Inside compass there is documents and aggregation tab just like in the data explorer ui
There is also a schema tab that allows you to have an overview of the shape of the data. (when created, how much of a document/data type, types and ranges of values)
Index tab allows for index creation and overview of existing indexes
Explain tab shows how certain data was retrieved. (shows how many docs it looked through and other data information)
If looking for docs filtering by fields there are indexes for, explain tab will show that it only searched through that index = faster
The explain tab shows when your filtering has been optimized
Validation tab allows you to establish rules for the data. You can deny certain value types for specific fields.
