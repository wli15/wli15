K14 -- Form and Function - using post/get forms in flask
2020-12-10

The inital @route ("/") uses the login template where the <form> </form> section is. 
All info in that form section is later created into a dictionary.
To access form data from login.html, rec=request.form is used, setting rec as thethe dictionary created

action="/auth" re routes you to the @route("/auth"") which results in the response.html template being used.
usern=req['username'] retrieves the info in the dictionary created to spit back into the response.html template in the {{usern}} portion




The post method is much more secure than the get method.
The get method shows the dictionary values in the url.

If the get method is used it's possible to
    retrieve an exact response by inputting a specific link
    reload the page without any errors
The post method requires a resubmission of the username each time to access the response.
