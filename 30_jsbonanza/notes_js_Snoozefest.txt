-to make random colors for the fillstyle, you need to use template strings in javascript, which are surrounded by backticks
 and equivalent to .format in python. the syntax is ${variable} inside the strings
-to animate multiple things, you need to create objects and store them in a list, then iterate through that list as you're
 drawing the next frame, and then request the next frame after all the iteration is done.
