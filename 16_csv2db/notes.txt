K16 -- No Trouble

Had a lot of trouble figuring out how to carry over values from python into our sqlite commands.
Solved this by using tuples and inserting tuples into a string so that the command would execute.
? marks denote parameters in sqlite.
Have to delete the created db_file in order to run again, otherwise a unique constraint error would occur.
