Would dean's code work if the csv file ended with.txt?

Where in karl's code does he chose randomly using the percentages?

In almost every code I see people setting the dictionary value to the percentage but never the occupation, why?

This reoccuring word weights? what does it do/significance?

I see that the 2 main ideas used were either the use of "weight" or the <= operator, I don't think I have seen both in the same file

What does print(f" ... ") do?

Why do some people use from ____ import ____, why not just import the whole module?

Remember that random.choice is a thing and not stick to just random.randint for everything
