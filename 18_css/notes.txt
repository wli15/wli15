When setting display as flex in css, all components within the tags will be flex items. Each item will appear as its own column.
Margins shift the text while padding doesnt. 
CSS follows inheritancde rules where outer tags act as parents and inside heading/body/links act as childs
Issue with internal css when changing the color of the links, when inspecting chrome, color:#d9d6c6; is crossed out
